“A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away… or actually, right here on Earth, I set out on a mission to build a budget-friendly robotic arm. Inspired by the droids of Star Wars, this arm might not fix an X-wing, but it’ll be as close as my wallet will allow! It’s still a work in progress, with parts being 3D-printed like they’re coming off the assembly line of a Rebel base.

Using the powers of Fusion 360 for design and VS Code for programming, I’m working toward a robotic arm that’s fit for a Padawan inventor. Between Jedi training—I mean school—and the occasional Wookiee-related distraction, I hope to complete this project soon. May the parts stay cheap, the coding bugs be few, and the servo motors be with me!”
